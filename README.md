# Video Tracking Project

This project is a **Video Completion Tracking Script** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It tracks whether users watch a video fully without skipping and displays a green check mark (`âœ”`) if completed successfully. If the user skips, it shows a message encouraging them to watch the full video.

## Features
- Skip Detection: Detects when a user skips any part of the video.
- Completion Tracking: Shows a green check mark for full completion.
- User-Friendly UI: Dynamic messages to guide users.

## How to Run
